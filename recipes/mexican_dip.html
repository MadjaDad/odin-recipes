    <h1>DA MEXICAN DIP YO !</h1>
    This Mexican dip for tortilla chips was given to me by my sister-in-law and always goes fast! 
    Cream cheese at the base of the dip makes it extra thick and scoopable. 
    Seasoned beef and vegetables make it extra filling and tasty. 
    You may want to prepare two batches. Serve with tortilla chips.
